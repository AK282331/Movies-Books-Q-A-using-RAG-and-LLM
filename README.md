# Personalized Recommendation System using RAG Methodology

## Overview
Recommendation systems are pivotal in decision-making processes across various domains such as entertainment and e-commerce. Traditional systems, however, often fall short in capturing the diverse and nuanced preferences of users. To address this limitation, we have developed a unique model using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique. This model allows users to find movies based on detailed descriptions, offering a more personalized and flexible approach to recommendations.

## Key Features
- **Flexible Recommendations**: Find movies, books, and web series based on detailed user descriptions.
- **Advanced NLP Capabilities**: Utilizes the Mixtral LLM Model for generating specific outputs.
- **Dynamic Context Retrieval**: Employs multiple tools to retrieve context based on user queries.

## Framework and Tools
### Langchain Framework
- Utilized for developing the Language Model (LLM).
### Groq Platform
- Utilized to access Mixtral 8x7b LLM Model
  
### Agent Tools
- **Wikipedia**: For general information retrieval.
- **Google**: For broad
